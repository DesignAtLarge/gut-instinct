# Gut Instinct Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to Gut Instinct, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.

### Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for
[review](https://github.com/DesignAtLarge/gutgame-proto/pulls),
make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the Gut Instinct coding style.
